i live in bellevue cadding every day
they know me where it rains

40 something milli triangles rendered every minute
from the screen to my eyes to my brain to my mouth
"whys it lagging" please help me
always screaming in the assembly
see i believe that if i see it in my brain
theres only a 50% chance that it will be cadded because im probably going to give up because onshape is so slow but now i got a new computer its like some funny server computer with really bad specs but it actually works and onshape runs at like a solid 30fps unlike that one laptop with a core 67 ultra and whatever that is very powerful and like onshape also runs really well on my phone not school computer but i think the cad is mostly done and i hate cad because i usually dont do it on this computer and its so laggy it makes me want to cry but now i can program and i can use the laptop without lag which is very cool!!!
